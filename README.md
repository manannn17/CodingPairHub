🚀 My First Hackathon Experience at UIC! 🚀

Last weekend, I participated in my first-ever hackathon at the University of Illinois Chicago, competing alongside 400+ students and 83 teams! The event was sponsored by John Deere, Grainger, UIC Engineering, CME Group, and Fulcrum, and it was an incredible learning experience.

I teamed up with Tanmay Patel and Rushil Patel to build CodePairHub, a peer-to-peer coding interview platform designed to help students practice mock interviews in real time.

💡 What is CodePairHub?

🔹 Smart Matchmaking – Pair with students based on difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard) and topics like Dynamic Programming, System Design, or Trees.

🔹 Live Coding Together – A built-in real-time code editor for Python, Java, C++, JavaScript, and more.

🔹 Video Calling – Communicate with your partner directly within the platform.

🔹 Turn-Based Interview Mode – One person codes while the other guides, then switch roles after 30 minutes.

🔹 Make Meaningful Connections – This isn’t just a practice tool, but a way to meet like-minded students!

💡 Why CodePairHub is a Game-Changer

✅ A Free Alternative – Many platforms like LeetCode and AlgoExpert charge students. CodePairHub is free for college students.

✅ Early Interview Prep – Helps universities train students from day one, not just in their final year.

✅ Support for Colleges with Limited Budgets – A peer-driven, cost-effective way to prepare students.

✅ University-Branded Questions – Colleges can add their own curated interview problems.

✅ Real-World Practice – Prepares students for actual coding interviews by developing problem-solving and communication skills.

🔥 What We Learned & What We’d Improve

🚀 UI/UX is key! We built our design using Figma, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, focusing on making the platform user-friendly.

🚀 Time management is everything. With just a short timeframe, we had to prioritize essential features over extras.

🚀 Communication matters. Working in a team taught me how to collaborate effectively under pressure.

🚀 Next Steps? We’d love to expand the project by integrating AI-powered feedback and more advanced matching features!

🏆 Did we win? No. But we walked away with something even more valuable—experience, teamwork, and new skills. Competing against some of the brightest minds at UIC was an honor, and I couldn’t have asked for a better team!

A huge thank you to UIC and all the sponsors for hosting such an incredible event. This was just the beginning, and I’m excited for more hackathons ahead!
